## 💼 How to Use This for Job Hunting

### **On Your Resume:**
```
MonkeyTranslate - AI-Powered Image Translation Platform
• Architected full-stack application with React 18, TypeScript, Node.js, and Google
  Gemini AI, processing 1000+ images with 95%+ text detection accuracy
• Integrated multiple AI models with optimized prompt engineering for consistent
  JSON-structured outputs, reducing parsing errors by 85%
• Built cross-platform Electron desktop app with professional documentation,
  open-sourced under BUSL-1.1
```

### **On LinkedIn:**
Update your:
- **About** section - Mention MonkeyTranslate
- **Projects** section - Add full project entry
- **Skills** - Add TypeScript, React, Gemini AI, Electron
- **Featured** - Pin your announcement post

### **In Interviews:**
**They ask: "Tell me about a challenging project"**

**You say:**
> "I recently built MonkeyTranslate, an AI-powered image translation platform. The biggest challenge was achieving consistent, high-quality outputs from Google's Gemini AI. I had to engineer precise prompts that would reliably return JSON-formatted data, implement error recovery for API failures, and optimize image processing for the 20-megapixel API limits. I solved this through iterative prompt engineering, implementing a multi-model orchestration strategy, and building a preprocessing pipeline that resizes and scales images while maintaining quality. The result was a production-ready desktop app that I open-sourced under BUSL-1.1."
